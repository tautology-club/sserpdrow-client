# Sserpdrow Client (DRAFT)

This is a Sserpdrow (Wordpress backwards) team project built at General
Assembly's Web Development Immersive.

This repository is an early draft of the client side of the project. We had
problems deploying to GitHub Pages from this repository, so the current client
or frontend of the project is [here](https://github.com/tautology-club/client-sserpdrow).

## Components of this Project

The early drafts of the frontend client are [here](https://github.com/tautology-club/sserpdrow-client).

The current frontend client repository is [here](https://github.com/tautology-club/client-sserpdrow).

The backend API repository is [here](https://github.com/tautology-club/sserpdrow-backend).

The deployed frontend client is [here](https://tautology-club.github.io/client-sserpdrow/).

The deployed backend API is [here](https://pacific-lake-39293.herokuapp.com/).

## Structure of this Repository

JavaScript files are all in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts). The "manifest"
or entry-point is [`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). That
file invokes [`assets/scripts/events.js`](assets/scripts/events.js), which
contains event listeners for the two buttons visible on the screen when the app
is accessed.

Specifically, the authentication content is handled in [`assets/scripts/auth`](assets/scripts/auth), the site or page content is in [`assets/scripts/page`](assets/scripts/page), and the blog post content is in [`assets/scripts/blog`](assets/scripts/blog).

`apiUrls.production` and `apiUrls.development` are configured in
[`config/environment.js`](config/environment.js).

Styles are stored in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and loaded
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss). Bootstrap version 3 is
included in this project.

[`getFormFields`](get-form-fields.md) is used to retrieve form data to send to an
API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA with this project, run `grunt deploy`.

## Development Process Notes

We used pair programming and version control extensively for this project. We
tracked our progress by frequently updating a roadmap document in Google Drive,
which is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdjX9aileNQHbDQVtufrlsvDyM5cQxRPhey_Hl8q9ao/edit?usp=sharing).

## Unsolved Problems and Possible Future Tasks

1. At present, our "pages" aren't really web pages - it's not possible to visit a subdomain for a specific "page."
1. "Pages" and "blogs" aren't connected in any meaningful way - it would be great if they were linked to each other.
1. Authentication is currently done through code hand-rolled by General Assembly instructors. Among other problems, this code never checks if the content in the "password" and "confirm password" boxes on the signup page are the same.
1. It isn't possible yet for users to share ownership of pages or blogs with each other, making our project fairly useless for organizations or teams.
